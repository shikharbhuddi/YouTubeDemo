# YouTubeDemo
A Native android application utilizing YouTube API, STT and TTS.

- You need to implement a mobile app which will embed a YouTube video player and user can play any public Youtube video after entering a URL such as 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u4G23_OohI"  [Hint: you can use Google official APIs for this task. There are extensive APIs/SDK for Android/React]
 
- You need to implement a voice note functionality. Where, user can pause the video and can record a voice note, which gets stored for future reference and labelled with YouTube video ID and time at which it is recorded (say 5u4G23_OohI @ 4:35). 
 
-  You can use Microsoft Cognitive API or Google Speech APIs to transcribe the voice note to text and display it as a list below the video (similar to how you see comments in youtube mobile app)
 
- If the user clicks on existing audio notes, the video will get played from the time at which it was recorded after audio note is played out.
